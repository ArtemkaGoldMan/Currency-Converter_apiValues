## How It Works

1. **Currency Selection**: 
   - The user selects the source currency (`From`) and the target currency (`To`) from dropdown menus populated with real-time exchange rates.
   
2. **Conversion Process**:
   - After entering the amount and selecting the currencies, the "Convert" button triggers the calculation, displaying the result in the target currency.
   
3. **Error Handling**: 
   - The app ensures valid input with error messages if required fields (amount or currency) are missing or incorrect.
   
4. **Reset**: 
   - With the click of the "Clear" button, all inputs are reset to their default state.

## Technologies Used

- **WPF**: The application leverages the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for its user interface, offering rich graphics and seamless user interaction.
- **C#**: The app logic, including currency data fetching and conversion, is implemented in C#.
- **OpenExchangeRates API**: The app connects to the OpenExchangeRates API to retrieve up-to-date exchange rates.
- **JSON**: Used for parsing the API responses and extracting currency data.
- **HTTP Client**: A modern async method for making API requests and fetching data efficiently.
